HTML & CSS standards
_____________________________________________________________________

HTML:

- Use html5 syntax
- ID's where occurence is unique
- CLASS's for everything else
- divide the html page into sections (header, footer....)
- leave TODO comment where work not completed
- put CSS link in header
- indent at all times (tab = 4 x spaces)
	<div>
		<p>sdfsfd</p>
	</div>
- use lowercase at all times
- put javascript ref to bottom of page
- separate css from html
- put alt tag in all <img> elements
- put title in <a> elements
- STOP SUPPORTING IE......
- use full range of <h> tags
- make list if IE fixes/things to avoid etc






CSS: 

- Use the SMACSS 5 categories (Base, Layout, Module, State, Theme)
- minimise depth (i.e. body #header #nav li )
- use child selectors
- don't use !important unless absolutely required
- class & id's named using hyphen e.g.
	.ui
	.ui-dialog
	.ui-dialog-title

	- keep them short & consistent
	- should be relative to use
	- ask will it be used somewhere else
- put each piece of styling on new line
- grouping of properties? 
- remove unused CSS
- use 6 hex characters for colours (#ffffff)
- useful to group certain css in style sheet, and comment with description
- sprites
- implement a grid system
- responsive design should be considered
